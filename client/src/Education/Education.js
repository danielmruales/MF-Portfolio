                <h1> EAS 1600 – Teaching and Learning Across Languages and Cultures</h1>
                <h3> 
                    This course served as one of my biggest exposure to other cultures, people, races, nationalities, and lived experiences. 
                    This class purposely diversified its students, so there was representation from 10+ countries and a predominance of international students. 
                    Since I have only ever known life as an American citizen, it was vital for me to experience interactions with others in order to understand our connections and differences. 
                    This course also exposed me to the concepts of cultural competency, ethnocentrism, and inter-cultural communication. 
                    This was also a great opportunity to talk about global cultures and diversity instead of just diversity and inclusion as it relates to the United States, 
                    which has been so important for having a global perspective and a holistic view of where diversity comes from and why it’s important. 
                    I also learned about cultural practices, values, norms, and histories 
                    that differ greatly from those I was familiar with. 
                    And, I learned to avoid applying my own world-view to everyone I interact with, 
                    and instead value diversity in order to better understand the world and be successful in it.

                <h1>MGT 5810 – Managing Diversity in Organizations</h1>
                <h3>
                    This course taught the history of diversity and inclusion as it relates to organizations and their progression over time. 
                    It also addressed the laws and policies that are in place to protect against 
                    discrimination and laid the ground rules for inclusive recruitment, hiring, and 
                    workplace policies. It also discussed the value of diversity, what diversity 
                    means, how to create inclusive workplace cultures, and how to diversify homogenous 
                    or discriminatory organizations. We were also given the opportunity to select and 
                    evaluate a local company’s diversity and inclusion plan, then build an improved version 
                    and present it to the organization based on the data we collected and what we had learned 
                    in the course. This served me in developing my impact statement because it gave me a 
                    formal training and an understanding of how this idea is being executed currently
                    and where I might be able to improve upon it. This also is the course most 
                    directly related to my impact statement, and will likely benefit me in terms of
                    credibility and exposure in the future.

                <h1>MGT 4860 – Managing Organizational Conflict</h1>
                <h3>
                This course served as an education in managing organizational conflict as well as a workshop for developing mediation and conflict management skills both personally and professionally. As diversity and inclusion work is notoriously difficult and controversial to introduce into organizations, having an understanding of conflict and the skill set to manage it is vital. This course also discussed diversity and its relationship to conflict, including the differences in varying cultures’ conflict styles, dynamics of male vs females in conflict, and creating psychological safety in organizations. For my final paper in this course, I explained the relationship between women in leadership and psychological safety in organizations. This allowed me to explore the existing climate of gender diversity in organizations as it relates to conflict, and gain a better understanding of how to improve it and facilitate greater human connection. This course was the most fundamentally impactful in terms of my understanding of how to facilitate, navigate, and maintain strong relationships and connections both personally and professionally. As this aligns directly with my impact statement, this course was greatly beneficial to guiding me towards my goals
